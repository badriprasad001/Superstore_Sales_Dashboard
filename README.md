# Superstore_Sales_Dashboard
I recently built an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize Super Store sales performance across multiple regions, categories, and time periods.

🔍 Project Overview

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key business metrics including:

Total Sales: 522K

Quantity Sold: 7,298

Total Profit: 68K

Average Delivery Time: 4 Days


📊 Key Insights

Year-over-Year (YoY) analysis for Monthly Sales and Profit Trends

Regional filters (Central, East, South, West) to compare performance

Sales distribution by Category, Subcategory, and Shipping Mode

Payment Mode Analysis (Cards, COD, Online)

Map visualization to track sales and profit by state


🧰 Tools & Techniques

Power BI for data visualization and interactive dashboard design

Power Query for data cleaning and transformation

DAX for KPI calculations and measures

Focus on data-driven storytelling and business insights

This project enhanced my skills in data modeling, visual analytics, and business performance tracking — key areas in Data Analytics.

🚀 I’m continuously learning and building impactful projects using Power BI, SQL, and Excel to strengthen my analytics portfolio.
